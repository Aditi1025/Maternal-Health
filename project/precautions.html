Your doctor (or other health care provider) will talk to you about what should be completely avoided, what should be greatly reduced, and what should be carefully considered during pregnancy.

</h3>

<ul >

<li> <h2> 1.Alcohol</h2>
<p> Should I avoid it? Yes! Although it may seem harmless to have a glass of wine at dinner or a mug of beer out with friends, no one knows what's a "safe amount" of alcohol to drink during pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is caused by drinking a lot of alcohol during pregnancy. What that amount is versus a safe amount is really not known. Because of the uncertainty, it's always wise to be cautious and not drink any alcohol at all during pregnancy.

What are the risks to my baby? Alcohol is one of the most common causes of physical, behavioral, and intellectual disabilities. It can be even more harmful to a developing fetus than heroin, cocaine, or marijuana use.

Alcohol is easily passed along to the baby, whose body is less able to get rid of alcohol than the mother's. That means an unborn baby tends to develop a high concentration of alcohol, which stays in the baby's system for longer periods than it would in the mother's. And moderate alcohol intake, as well as periodic binge drinking, can possibly damage a baby's developing nervous system.

What can I do about it? If you had a drink or two before you even knew you were pregnant (as many women do), don't worry too much about it. But your best bet is to not drink any more alcohol for the rest of your pregnancy.

If you're an alcoholic or think you may have a drinking problem, talk to your doctor about it. He or she needs to know how much alcohol you've consumed and when during your pregnancy to get a better idea of how your unborn baby might be affected. Your doctor also can start you on a path to getting the help you need to stop drinking — for your sake and your baby's.</p>
</li>
	<li>  <h2>2. Caffeine</h2> <p> Should I avoid and/or limit it? Yes. It's wise to cut down or stop caffeine intake. Studies show that caffeine consumption of more than 200–300 milligrams a day (about 2–3 cups of coffee, depending on the portion size, brewing method, and brand) might put a pregnancy at risk. Less than that amount is probably safe.

What are the risks to my baby? High caffeine consumption has been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage and, possibly, other pregnancy complications.

What can I do about it? If you're having a hard time cutting out coffee all at once, here's how you can start:

Cut your consumption down to one or two cups a day.
Gradually reduce the amount by combining decaffeinated coffee with regular coffee.
Eventually cut out the regular coffee altogether.
And remember that caffeine is not only in coffee. Green and black tea, cola, and other soft drinks contain caffeine. Try switching to decaffeinated products (which may still have some caffeine, but in much smaller amounts) or caffeine-free alternatives.

If you're wondering about chocolate, which also has caffeine, the good news is that you can eat some in moderation. A cup of brewed coffee has 95–135 milligrams of caffeine, but the average chocolate bar has 5–30 milligrams. So, small amounts of chocolate are fine.</p> </li>

	 <li>  <h2>3.Certain Foods </h2> <p> Are there some I should avoid? Yes. Foods that are more likely to be contaminated with bacteria or heavy metals are ones to try to avoid or limit your exposure to. Those you should steer clear of during pregnancy include:

soft, unpasteurized cheeses (often advertised as "fresh") such as feta, goat, Brie, Camembert, blue-veined cheeses, and Mexican queso fresco
unpasteurized milk, juices, and apple cider
raw eggs or foods containing raw eggs, including mousse, tiramisu, raw cookie dough, eggnog, homemade ice cream, and Caesar dressing
raw or undercooked fish (sushi), shellfish, or meats
paté and meat spreads
processed meats like hot dogs and deli meats (these should be very well cooked before eating)
Also, although fish and shellfish can be an extremely healthy part of your pregnancy diet (they contain beneficial omega-3 fatty acids and are high in protein and low in saturated fat), you should avoid eating certain kinds due to high levels of mercury, which can damage the brain of a developing fetus.

Fish to avoid:

shark
swordfish
king mackerel
tilefish
tuna steak (limited amounts of canned, preferably light, tuna is OK)
What are the risks to my baby? Although it's important to eat plenty of healthy foods during pregnancy, you also need to avoid foodborne illnesses, such as listeriosis, toxoplasmosis, and salmonella, which are caused by the bacteria that can be found in certain foods. These infections can be life-threatening to an unborn baby and may cause birth defects or miscarriage.

What can I do about it? Be sure to thoroughly wash all fruits and vegetables, which can carry bacteria or be coated with pesticide residue. And be mindful of what you're buying at the grocery store or when dining out.

When you choose seafood, eat a variety of fish and shellfish and limit the amount to about 12 ounces per week — that's about two meals. Common fish and shellfish that are low in mercury include: canned light tuna, catfish, pollock, salmon, and shrimp. But because albacore (or white) tuna has more mercury than canned light tuna, it's best to eat no more than 6 ounces (or one meal) of albacore tuna a week.

You may have to skip a few foods during pregnancy that you normally enjoy. But just think how delicious they'll taste when you can have them again!

</p> </li>

<li>  <h2>4.Changing the Litter Box </h2> <p>Should I avoid it? Yes. Pregnancy is the prime time to get out of cleaning kitty's litter box. But that doesn't mean that you have to keep away from Fluffy!

What are the risks to my baby? An infection called toxoplasmosis can be spread through soiled cat litter boxes and can cause serious problems in a fetus, including prematurity, poor growth, and severe eye and brain damage. A pregnant woman who becomes infected often has no symptoms but can still pass the infection on to her developing baby.

What can I do about it? Have someone else change the litter box, making sure to clean it thoroughly and regularly, then wash his or her hands well afterward.
</p> </li>



<li>  <h2>OTC and Prescription Medicines </h2> <p>Should I avoid them? Some, yes; others, no. There are many medicines you should not use during pregnancy. Be sure to talk to your doctor about which prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs you can and can't take, even if they seem like no big deal.

What are the risks to my baby? Even common OTC medicines that you can buy in stores without a prescription may be off-limits during pregnancy because of their potential effects on the baby. Certain prescription medicines may also harm the developing fetus. (The type of harm and extent of possible damage depends on the kind of medication.)

Also, although they may seem harmless, herbal remedies and supplements are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). That means that they don't have to follow any safety standards and thus could be harmful to your baby.

What can I do about it? To make sure you don't take anything that could put your baby at risk, talk to your doctor about:

any medicines you're taking — prescription and OTC — and ask which are safe to take during pregnancy
any concerns you have about natural remedies, supplements, and vitamins
Also, let all of your health care providers know that you're pregnant so that they'll keep that in mind when recommending or prescribing any medicines. If you were prescribed a medication before you became pregnant for an illness, disease, or condition that you still have, your doctor can help you weigh the potential benefits and risks of continuing your prescription.

If you become sick (for example, with a cold) or have symptoms that cause you discomfort or pain (like a headache or backache), talk to your doctor about medicines you can take and other ways to help you feel better without medication.

Also, if you are in your third trimester, talk to your health care professional if you are scheduled to have surgery or a medical procedure that would require the use of general anesthesia. The FDA has issued a warning about its possible effects on an unborn baby's brain development.

</p> </li>



<li>  <h2> 7.Recreational Drugs</h2> <p>Should I avoid them? Yes!

What are the risks to my baby? Pregnant women who use drugs may be placing their unborn babies at risk for:

premature birth
poor growth
birth defects
behavior and learning problems
And their babies could also be born addicted to those drugs.

What can I do about it? If you've used any drugs at any time during your pregnancy, it's important to tell your doctor. Even if you've quit, your unborn child could still be at risk for health problems. If you're still using drugs, talk to your doctor for help on how to quit. Health clinics such as Planned Parenthood also can recommend health care providers, at little or no cost, who can help you quit your habit and have a healthier pregnancy.



</p> </li>



<li>  <h2>8. Smoking</h2> <p>Should I avoid it? Yes! You wouldn't light a cigarette, put it in your baby's mouth, and encourage your little one to puff away. As ridiculous as this sounds, pregnant women who continue to smoke are allowing their fetus to smoke too. The smoking mother passes nicotine, carbon monoxide, and many other chemicals to her growing baby.

Likewise, you should avoid people who are smoking, whether they're coworkers, friends, family members, or people in public places.

What are the risks to my baby? If a pregnant woman smokes, it could cause:

miscarriage or stillbirth
prematurity
low birth weight
sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
asthma and other respiratory problems
And the risks to a fetus from regular exposure to secondhand smoke include low birth weight and slowed growth.

What can I do about it? If you smoke, having a baby may be the reason you need to quit. Talk to your doctor about options for kicking the habit.

If you spend time with people who smoke, ask them nicely to do it outside — and away from you if you're outside as well. 

</p> </li>



<li>  <h2>9. Artificial Sweeteners (Sugar Substitutes)</h2> <p>Should I avoid them? Some are OK, others are best to avoid.

Aspartame, sucralose, stevioside, and acesulfame-K have been found to be safe to use in moderation during pregnancy. However, you should avoid aspartame if you or your partner has a rare hereditary disease called phenylketonuria (PKU), in which the body can't break down the compound phenylalanine, which is found in aspartame. In that case, you should avoid aspartame altogether since your baby may also be born with the disease.

Experts are still unsure about whether saccharin, which is found in some foods and in the little pink packets, is safe to use during pregnancy — it can cross the placenta and could stay in the fetus' tissue. Also, a sweetener called cyclamate is banned in the United States because of concerns about a possible link to cancer.

What are the risks, if any, to my baby? Although some people say that the artificial sweetener aspartame is linked to birth defects and illnesses, government authorities and medical groups throughout the world have evaluated aspartame and approved it as safe for human consumption, including during pregnancy.

Research done during the 1970s suggested that saccharin caused bladder cancer in lab rats when given in large quantities. Since then, though, those studies have often been called into question. Also, a warning saying that it could cause cancer was removed from all saccharin-containing products' labels in 2000.

What can I do about it? With aspartame, sucralose, stevioside, and acesulfame-K, moderation is the key. It's OK to have an occasional diet soda or sugar-free food with these sweeteners here and there. But if you're really craving something sweet, it's probably better to have the real thing, as long as it's in moderation.

If you've already had something with saccharin in it during your pregnancy, don't obsess about it. It's highly unlikely that small amounts could harm your baby.

Still, it's wise to check product labels and try to avoid — or at least limit — anything with artificial sweeteners (especially saccharin), just to be safe. After all, this is one time in your life when you have a good reason to avoid diet foods! And the more naturally flavored whole foods you eat during pregnancy, the better.
