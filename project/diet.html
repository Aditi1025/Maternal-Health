<ul >

<li> <h2> 1. Dairy products </h2>
<p> During pregnancy, you need to consume extra protein and calcium to meet the needs of your growing little one. Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt should be on the docket.

Dairy products contain two types of high-quality protein: casein and whey. Dairy is the best dietary source of calcium, and provides high amounts of phosphorus, B vitamins, magnesium, and zinc.

Yogurt, especially Greek yogurt, contains more calcium than most other dairy products and is especially beneficial. Some varieties also contain probiotic bacteria, which support digestive health.

If you’re lactose intolerant, you may also be able to tolerate yogurtTrusted Source, especially probiotic yogurt. Check with your doctor to see if you can test it out. A whole world of yogurt smoothies, parfaits, and lassi could be waiting.</p>
</li>
	<li>  <h2>2. Legumes </h2> <p> This group of food includes lentils, peas, beans, chickpeas, soybeans, and peanuts (aka all kinds of fabulous recipe ingredients!).

Legumes are great plant-based sources of fiber, protein, iron, folate, and calcium — all of which your body needs more of during pregnancy.

Folate is one of the most essential B vitamins (B9). It’s very important for you and baby, especially during the first trimester, and even before.

You’ll need at least 600 micrograms (mcg) of folateTrusted Source every day, which can be a challenge to achieve with foods alone. But adding in legumes can help get you there along with supplementation based on your doctor’s recommendation.

Legumes are generally very high in fiber, too. Some varieties are also high in iron, magnesium, and potassium. Consider adding legumes to your diet with meals like hummus on whole grain toast, black beans in a taco salad, or a lentil curry.</p> </li>

	 <li>  <h2>3. Sweet potatoes </h2> <p> Sweet potatoes are not only delicious cooked about a thousand ways, they’re also rich in beta carotene, a plant compound that is converted into vitamin A in your body.

Vitamin A is essential for baby’s development. Just watch out for excessive amounts of animal-based sources of vitamin A, such as organ meats, which can cause toxicityTrusted Source in high amounts.

Thankfully, sweet potatoes are an ample plant-based source of beta carotene and fiber. Fiber keeps you full longer, reduces blood sugar spikes, and improves digestive health (which can really help if that pregnancy constipation hits).

For a fab brekky, try sweet potatoes as a base for your morning avocado toast.

</p> </li>

<li>  <h2>4. Salmon</h2> <p>Smoked on a whole wheat bagel, teriyaki grilled, or slathered in pesto, salmon is a welcome addition to this list. Salmon is rich in essential omega-3 fatty acids that have a host of benefits.

These are found in high amounts in seafood, and help build the brain and eyes of your baby and can even help increase gestational length.

But wait: Have you been told to limit your seafood intake due to the mercury and other contaminants found in high mercury fish? You can still eat fatty fish like salmon.

Here are the high mercury fish to avoidTrusted Source:

swordfish
shark
king mackerel
marlin
bigeye tuna
tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico
Plus, salmon is one of the very few natural sources of vitamin D, which is lacking for most of us. It’s important for bone health and immune function.
</p> </li>



<li>  <h2>6. Broccoli and dark, leafy greens </h2> <p>TNo surprise here: Broccoli and dark, green vegetables, such as kale and spinach, pack in so many of the nutrients you’ll need. Even if you don’t love eating them, they can often be squirreled into all kinds of dishes.

Benefits include fiber, vitamin C, vitamin K, vitamin A, calcium, iron, folate, and potassium. They’re a bonanza of green goodness.

Adding in servings of green veggies is an efficient way to pack in vitamins and fend off constipation due to all that fiber. Vegetables have also been linked to a reduced risk of low birth weightTrusted Source.

Try this kale eggs Florentine recipe or blend some spinach into a green smoothie and you won’t even know it’s in there.

</p> </li>



<li>  <h2> 7. Lean meat and proteins</h2> <p>TLean beef, pork, and chicken are excellent sources of high-quality protein. Beef and pork are also rich in iron, choline, and other B vitamins — all of which you’ll need in higher amounts during pregnancy.

Iron is an essential mineral that is used by red blood cells as a part of hemoglobin. You’ll need more iron since your blood volume is increasing. This is particularly important during your third trimester.

Low levels of iron during early and mid-pregnancy may cause iron deficiency anemia, which increases the risk of low birth weightTrusted Source and other complications.

It can be hard to cover your iron needs with meals alone, especially if you develop an aversion to meat or are vegetarian or vegan. However, for those who can, eating lean red meat regularly may help increase the amount of iron you’re getting from food.

Pro tip: Pairing foods that are rich in vitamin C, such as oranges or bell peppers, along with iron-rich foods may also help increase absorption.

Toss some vitamin C-rich tomato slices on that turkey burger or whip up this steak and mango salad.

</p> </li>



<li>  <h2>8. Berries</h2> <p>Berries hold a lot of goodness in their tiny packages like water, healthy carbs, vitamin C, fiber, and antioxidants.

Berries have a relatively low glycemic index value, so they should not cause major spikes in blood sugar.

Berries are also a great snack, as they contain both water and fiber. They provide a lot of flavor and nutrition, but with relatively few calories.

Some of the best berries to eat while pregnant are blueberries, raspberries, goji berries, strawberries, and acai berries. Check out this blueberry smoothie for some inspiration.


</p> </li>



<li>  <h2>9. Whole grains</h2> <p>Unlike their refined counterparts, whole grains are packed with fiber, vitamins, and plant compounds. Think oats, quinoa, brown rice, wheat berries, and barley instead of white bread, pasta, and white rice.

Some whole grains, like oats and quinoa, also contain a fair amount of protein. They also hit a few buttons that are often lacking in pregnant people: B vitamins, fiber, and magnesium.

There are so many ways to adds whole grains to any meal, but we’re especially liking this quinoa and roasted sweet potato bowl.
</p> </li>



<li>  <h2>10. Avocados</h2> <p>Avocados are an unusual fruit because they contain a lot of monounsaturated fatty acids. This makes them taste buttery and rich — perfect for adding depth and creaminess to a dish.

They’re also high in fiber, B vitamins (especially folate), vitamin K, potassium, copper, vitamin E, and vitamin C.

Because of their high content of healthy fats, folate, and potassium, avocados are a great choice during pregnancy (and always).

The healthy fats help build the skin, brain, and tissues of your little one, and folate may help prevent neural tube defects, developmental abnormalities of the brain and spine such as spina bifida.

Potassium may help relieve leg cramps, a side effect of pregnancy for some women. In fact, avocados contain more potassiumTrusted Source than bananas.

Try them as guacamole, in salads, in smoothies, and on whole wheat toast, but also as a substitute for mayo or sour cream.


</p> </li>



<li>  <h2>11. Dried fruit</h2> <p>Dried fruit is generally high in calories, fiber, and various vitamins and minerals. One piece of dried fruit contains the same amount of nutrients as fresh fruit, just without all the water and in a much smaller form.

One serving of dried fruit can provide a large percentage of the recommended intake of many vitamins and minerals, including folate, iron, and potassium.

Prunes are rich in fiber, potassium, and vitamin K. They’re natural laxatives and may be very helpful in relieving constipation. Dates are high in fiber, potassium, iron, and plant compounds.

However, dried fruit also contains high amounts of natural sugar. Make sure to avoid the candied varieties, which contain even more sugar.

Although dried fruit may help increase calorie and nutrient intake, it’s generally not recommended to consume more than one serving at a time.

Try adding a small portion to a trail mix with nuts and seeds for an on-the-go protein- and fiber-filled snack.
</p> </li>



<li>  <h2>12. Fish liver oil</h2> <p>Fish liver oil is made from the oily liver of fish, most often cod. It’s rich in the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, which are essential for fetal brain and eye development.

Supplementing with fish oil may help protect against preterm delivery and may benefit fetal eye development.

Fish liver oil is also very high in vitamin D, of which many people don’t get enough. It may be highly beneficial for those who don’t regularly eat seafood or supplement with omega-3 or vitamin D.

A single serving (1 tablespoon or 15 milliliters) of fish liver oil provides more than the recommended daily intake of omega-3, vitamin D, and vitamin A.

However, it’s not recommended to consume more than one serving per day, as too much preformed vitamin A can be dangerous for your baby. High levels of omega-3 may also have blood-thinning effects.

Low mercury fish like salmon, sardines, canned light tuna, or pollock can also help get you to your omega-3 goals.


</p> </li>



<li>  <h2>13. Water</h2> <p>Say it with me: We all have to stay hydrated. And pregnant folks especially. During pregnancy, blood volume increases by about 45 percentTrusted Source.

Your body will channel hydration to your baby, but if you don’t watch your water intake, you may become dehydrated yourself.

Symptoms of mild dehydration include headaches, anxiety, tiredness, bad mood, and reduced memory.

Increasing your water intake may also help relieve constipation and reduce your risk of urinary tract infections, which are common during pregnancy.

General guidelines recommend that pregnant women drink about 80 ounces (2.3 liters) of water daily. But the amount you really need varies. Check with your doctor for a recommendation based on your specific needs.

Keep in mind that you also get water from other foods and beverages, such as fruit, vegetables, coffee, and tea.

Pro tip: Try keeping a reusable water bottle on hand so that you can quench your thirst throughout the day.
