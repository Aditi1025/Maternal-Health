# Maternal-Health
## Problem Statement: 
There is a maternal health crisis worldwide. The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 295,000 women die a year from pregnancy-related causes. The truth is that most maternal deaths are actually preventable, as the health-care solutions to prevent or manage complications are well known. All women need is access to high-quality care during pregnancy, and during and after childbirth.
